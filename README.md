Hello!

This app was a full rebuild of an early Flatiron bootcamp project which used Ruby to build a cli 3x3 TicTacToe app.

In contrast to that original app, this project was built with React & Javascript exclusively and is a much more difficult 4x4 TicTacToe type game with original rules. I built this unique game so that it would be apparrent that my code is original and creative, since many 3x3 TicTacToe examples exist online.

View the live game at [Kirby's TicTacToe 4x4 Game](https://www.tichacktoe.jkirbycampbell.com/).  
Feel free to play 0, 1, or 2 player games. You may also play multiple games, while the overall scores of all games is added up at the bottom!

The most complicated point of this project is the new React Hooks version of Redux, which is called useReducer. You may see the core of my state management at [reducers.js](https://github.com/kirbycampbell/hikhakjoe/blob/master/src/context/reducers.js).

The code for the ai exists in my [aiMethods.js](https://github.com/kirbycampbell/hikhakjoe/blob/master/src/Components/aiMethods.js) javascript file.
